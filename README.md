# product-shop-price
An inventory system where customers can see what products are available &amp; more. This project is served as school assignement where backend skills are practiced

## Run project

I've made an alias to start xampp, so the following command will not work for anyone else.

```sh
x
```

```sh
php artisan serve
```

```sh
npm run dev
```
